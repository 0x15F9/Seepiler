# Seepiler
A utility tool which I built for my personal use to compile files with .cpp extension to .out

### Note
To allow execution, use
> chmod +x seepiler.sh

---

## Usage

### Convert a single .cpp file to .out
> ./seepiler.sh Foo.cpp

The compiled binary is saved as foo.out

### Convert all .cpp files to .out
> ./seepiler.sh

All compiled files are saved as originalName.out. The first character of the binary is converted to lower-case.
